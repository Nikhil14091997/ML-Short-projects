In this case study, my task is to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using features obtained from several cell images.
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
